# Project-AWS-HoneyPot
This project is an AWS honeypot designed to attract and analyze malicious traffic. It uses an isolated EC2 instance with intentionally exposed ports, custom Security Group rules, and CloudWatch logging to track inbound attacks. Collected logs are analyzed to identify attacker patterns, common scanning behavior, and attempted exploit techniques.
